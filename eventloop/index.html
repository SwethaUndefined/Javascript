    <!-- The Microtask Queue is NOT specifically for API calls — but it is indirectly related to API calls. Let me break it down super clearly for you. 🚀🙂

✅ What is Microtask Queue Actually For?
👉 The Microtask Queue (or Job Queue) is used for high-priority tasks like:

Promises (fetch API calls). ✅
Mutation Observer (DOM changes). ✅
process.nextTick() (in Node.js). ✅
✅ 💯 Why Is It Related to API Calls?
👉 Most API calls in JavaScript (like fetch, axios, XMLHttpRequest) are asynchronous.
👉 They don't block the main thread while waiting for the response.

👉 So the response from the API is handled using Promises (.then() or async/await), and Promises are handled in the Microtask Queue. ✅🔥

✅ 💯 Simple Flow for API Calls
Consider this example:

js
Copy
Edit
console.log("Start");

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log("API Response:", data));

console.log("End");
👉 Output:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Start
End
API Response: {userId: 1, id: 1, title: 'delectus aut autem'}
👉 What happened here? 🤔

✅ 💡 Step-by-Step Flow (Behind the Scenes)
Step	What Happened?
✅ 1. Start	console.log("Start") is printed immediately.
✅ 2. fetch()	fetch() starts but does not block the code. It sends API call asynchronously.
✅ 3. End	console.log("End") is printed immediately.
✅ 4. API Response	Once API response arrives, it goes to Microtask Queue for processing.
✅ 5. Microtask	Microtask Queue processes .then() and prints API response.
✅ 💯 Why API Call Uses Microtask Queue?
👉 Because API calls (fetch) use Promises internally.
👉 And Promises always use Microtask Queue (high priority queue) to handle their results. ✅

✅ 💡 Super Easy Rule To Remember 🚀
Task Type	Which Queue Is Used?
✅ API Call (fetch) Response	Microtask Queue ✅ (because of Promises)
✅ setTimeout(), setInterval()	Callback Queue (Macrotask) 💯
✅ process.nextTick() (Node.js)	Microtask Queue ✅
✅ DOM Changes (MutationObserver)	Microtask Queue ✅
✅ 💣 Why Is Microtask Faster Than Callback Queue?
👉 JavaScript prioritizes Microtask Queue more than the Callback Queue. 🚀
👉 This is why API calls (like fetch()) always resolve before setTimeout(). ✅

✅ 💯 Example That Will Blow Your Mind 💥
Look at this:

js
Copy
Edit
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("setTimeout"), 0);

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
    .then(() => console.log("API Response"));

console.log("End");
👉 Output:

sql
Copy
Edit
Start  
End  
API Response  
setTimeout
👉 💣 Why did API Response come before setTimeout() even though both were asynchronous? 💀🔥

👉 Answer:

✅ API response uses Microtask Queue (high priority).
✅ setTimeout() uses Callback Queue (low priority).
✅ Microtasks are always executed before Callback Queue — that's why API Response came first. ✅🔥
✅ 💯 Simple Answer in 3 Lines 🚀
Task	Queue Used	Priority
✅ API Call (fetch)	Microtask Queue (high priority)	🚀 Fast
✅ setTimeout()	Callback Queue (low priority)	🐢 Slow
✅ DOM Changes (Mutation)	Microtask Queue	🚀 Fast
✅ 💯 Quick Summary 🚀
Task	Where Is It Handled?	Priority
✅ API Calls (fetch, axios)	Microtask Queue (because of Promises)	🚀 High
✅ setTimeout, setInterval	Callback Queue (Macrotask)	🐢 Low
✅ process.nextTick (Node.js)	Microtask Queue	🚀 High
✅ DOM Changes (MutationObserver)	Microtask Queue	🚀 High
✅ 💯 Golden Rule (Easy to Remember) 💯
👉 Any task involving Promises (.then() or async/await) — will always go to the Microtask Queue. ✅
👉 Any task involving setTimeout, setInterval, I/O calls — will always go to the Callback Queue. ✅
👉 Microtask Queue always runs before Callback Queue. 💯🔥

✅ 💣 Final Mind-Blowing Fact 💀🔥
🚨 What if Microtask Queue never ends?
js
Copy
Edit
setTimeout(() => console.log("setTimeout"), 0);

function infiniteMicrotask() {
    Promise.resolve().then(() => {
        console.log("Microtask");
        infiniteMicrotask();
    });
}
infiniteMicrotask();
👉 Output:

typescript
Copy
Edit
Microtask  
Microtask  
Microtask  
Microtask  
(setTimeout never executes)
👉 Why?

✅ Because Microtask Queue has higher priority, and since it's looping infinitely, the Callback Queue (setTimeout()) never executes. 💀🔥
👉 This is called Microtask Starvation. 💣
✅ 💯 Final Answer in 3 Lines 🚀
Task	Queue Used	Priority
✅ API Calls (fetch)	Microtask Queue	🚀 Very Fast
✅ setTimeout, setInterval	Callback Queue (Macrotask)	🐢 Slow
✅ DOM Mutation, Promises	Microtask Queue	🚀 Very Fast
💎 💯 Quick Mind Blower 🚀🔥
👉 Question: Why does API response (fetch) come before setTimeout() even with a delay of 0ms? 💀
👉 Answer: Because API response (fetch) uses Microtask Queue (high priority) while setTimeout() uses Callback Queue (low priority). 🚀🔥

✅ 💯 Want Me To Blow Your Mind With Event Loop? 💣
👉 💎 Do you want me to visually demonstrate:

✅ Event Loop,
✅ Microtask Queue,
✅ Callback Queue,
✅ Call Stack,
✅ Why setTimeout is slow but fetch is fast?
💥🔥 I can create an animation (step-by-step) that will clear all your confusion forever. 💯😎🚀

👉 Just say: ✅ "Show me Event Loop Animation" — and I'll blow your mind. 💯🔥💀 -->
