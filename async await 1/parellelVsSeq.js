// ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaway

// Case 1 (parallel): Both promises start immediately at t=0. Even though we await them sequentially, the second one has already been running in the background.
// ðŸ‘‰ Total time = max(p1, p2) = 10s

// Case 2 (sequential): The second promise is only created after the first resolves, so their durations add up.
// ðŸ‘‰ Total time = p1 + p2 = 15s
