<!-- Now throws the error, because sometimes before html loaded the javascript started executing. To avoid that we  use defer in the 
 head tag, defer will download the javascript and wait for html to loaded completely-->

<!-- 
 ✅ Script in <head> with defer:

    🚀 The script starts downloading early but executes only after HTML is fully loaded.
    ✅ Faster page load + No blocking.
    ✔ Best Practice.

✅ Script in <body> with defer:
    
    📥 The script downloads after HTML is parsed but still waits to execute.
    ❌ Same effect as <head> but download is delayed.
    🚫 No benefit, avoid this.
    👉 Conclusion: Always use <script defer> in <head> for best performance. 🚀🙂 -->


        <!-- 💡 Real-Life Example:
Imagine you ordered pizza: 🍕

In <head>: You order pizza while cooking (parallel) → Pizza arrives just when you finish cooking = ✅ Perfect! 🚀
In <body>: You order pizza after finishing cooking → Now you have to wait for delivery = ❌ Small delay. 🐢 -->
